      <h1>What is Cyber Safety?</h1>
      <p>Cyber safety is all about protecting yourself online. It means keeping your personal info, accounts, and devices safe from threats. It’s like having a digital shield that helps you stay secure while browsing, chatting, shopping, or scrolling through social media.</p>

      <h2>Common Online Risks</h2>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Fake emails or messages try to trick you into giving out passwords or personal information. Think of those “you won a million bucks” messages, don’t fall for them.</li>
        <li><strong>Scams:</strong> Fake prizes, sketchy job offers, and dodgy online shopping deals are everywhere. Always double-check before trusting something online.</li>
        <li><strong>Malware:</strong> Malicious programs that can sneak into your device and steal information or mess things up. It’s basically a digital virus.</li>
        <li><strong>Identity Theft:</strong> This happens when someone steals your details to pretend to be you and cause trouble. Protect your info so this doesn’t happen.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Filipinos Are Vulnerable</h2>
      <p>High social media use, online shopping, and limited cyber awareness make many people targets. Simple habits like weak passwords or clicking unknown links increase risk.</p>
